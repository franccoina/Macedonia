Welcome to our __Exclusive Restaurant Website__ project, __Macedonia__. This website allows owners of exclusive restaurants to publish information about their establishments to attract new customers. Users of the site can explore a list of exclusive restaurants, view details such as the name, description, and location, and most importantly, make reservations at these places. On the other hand, if they are restaurant owners, they can publish and manage information about their establishments.

## Why Macedonia?

__Macedonia__ has been created to address the need for accessible information about gastronomic tourism, simplifying the experience of discovering and reserving at new exclusive dining spots. We aim to bring back the excitement and mystery of trying new flavors, providing reliability, quality, and the certainty of connecting with the hottest venues.

## Features

1. *Restaurant Exploration*: 
   - Users can browse a list of exclusive restaurants.
   - Each listed restaurant includes general information, such as the name, a brief description, and the location.
   - Making a reservation is one of the main functions, and in the spirit of mystery and adventure, more details about the venue will only be revealed upon making a reservation.

2. *Restaurant Publishing*:
   - Restaurant owners can create an account and publish their restaurants on the site.
   - They can provide and edit important details such as the restaurant name, an appealing description, and its location.
   - Owners can view the list of reservations made at each establishment and relevant information about each one.
